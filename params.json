{"name":"Phconvert","tagline":"Reference library to write (and read) Photon-HDF5 files","body":"# phconvert\r\n\r\n*phconvert* is a python 2 & 3 library that helps writing valid\r\n<a href=\"http://photon-hdf5.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Photon-HDF5</a>\r\nfiles, a file format for time stamp-based single-molecule spectroscopy.\r\nAdditionally, *phconvert* can convert a few common binary formats\r\nused in in single-molecule spectroscopy (PicoQuant .HT3,\r\nBecker & Hickl .SPC/.SET) to Photon-HDF5.\r\n\r\nFor questions or issues running this software please use the\r\n[Photon-HDF5 Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/photon-hdf5)\r\nor open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Photon-HDF5/phconvert/issues).\r\n\r\n## Quick-start: Converting files to Photon-HDF5\r\n\r\nConverting one of the supported files formats to Photon-HDF5 does not require\r\nbeing able to program in python. All you need is running the \"notebook\"\r\ncorresponding to the file format you want to convert from, and follow the instructions therein.\r\n\r\nFor demonstration purposes, the notebooks can be executed online without any installation (courtesy [MyBinder.org](http://mybinder.org/)).\r\nWith this online service, you can convert data files up to 35MB to Photon-HDF5.\r\nTo launch the demo click on the following button:\r\n\r\n[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/Photon-HDF5/Photon-HDF5-Converter)\r\n\r\nTo execute the phconvert notebooks on your machine, you need to install the *Jupyter Notebook App* first.\r\nA quick-start guide on installing and running the *Jupyter Notebook App* is available here:\r\n\r\n- <a href=\"http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Jupyter/IPython Notebook Quick Start Guide</a>\r\n\r\nNext, you need to install the *phconvert* library with the following command\r\n(type it in *Terminal* on OS X or Linux, or in the `cmd` prompt on Windows):\r\n\r\n    conda install -c tritemio phconvert\r\n\r\nFinally, you can download one of the provided notebooks and run it on your machine.\r\nSimply, download the\r\n[phconvert zip](https://github.com/Photon-HDF5/phconvert/archive/master.zip),\r\nwhich contains all the notebooks in the `notebooks` subfolder.\r\n\r\n###For questions or issues:\r\n\r\n- [Open an GitHub issue](https://github.com/Photon-HDF5/phconvert/issues) or\r\n- Ask a question on the [Photon-HDF5 Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/photon-hdf5).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project details\r\n\r\n### What's inside?\r\n\r\n*phconvert* repository contains a python package (library) and a set of\r\n[notebooks](https://github.com/Photon-HDF5/phconvert/tree/master/notebooks)\r\n([online viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Photon-HDF5/phconvert/tree/master/notebooks/)).\r\nEach notebook can convert a different format to Photon-HDF5 using the phconvert library.\r\n\r\nIf you have a file format that is not yet supported, please [open an new Issue](https://github.com/Photon-HDF5/phconvert/issues).\r\nWe are willing add support for as many file formats as possible!\r\n\r\n### Why phconvert?\r\n\r\nWhen writing Photon-HDF5 files, phconvert saves you time\r\nand protects you against common programming errors that risk\r\nto make the file not a valid Photon-HDF5.\r\n\r\nIn principle, Photon-HDF5 files can be written directly using only pytables\r\nor other HDF5 libraries.\r\nIn practice, the process of manually creating each field is tedious and error prone:\r\nit's easy to make spelling errors in field names or to forget a mandatory field.\r\nTo help this task, we provide a\r\n[JSON file](https://github.com/Photon-HDF5/phconvert/blob/master/phconvert/specs/photon-hdf5_specs.json)\r\nwhich contains the list Photon-HDF5 field names, types, and descriptions.\r\n*phconvert*, uses this JSON file to make sure that the input field names (and types)\r\nare valid. Additionally, phconvert adds a description to each field,\r\nextracting it from the JSON file.\r\n\r\n## Read Photon-HDF5 files\r\n\r\nIn case you just want to read Photon-HDF5 files you don't need to use phconvert.\r\nPhoton-HDF5 files can be directly opened with a standard HDF5 viewer\r\n[HDFView](https://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/).\r\nMoreover, we provide code examples of reading Photon-HDF5 files\r\nin multiple languages in\r\n[this repository](https://github.com/Photon-HDF5/photon_hdf5_reading_examples).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe recommended way to install *phconvert* is by using conda (which first\r\nrequires installing the free python distribution\r\n[Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) from Continuum):\r\n\r\n    conda install -c tritemio phconvert\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can install *phconvert* in any python installation using PIP:\r\n\r\n    pip install phconvert\r\n\r\nIn this latter case, make sure that numpy and pytables are installed.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n- python 2.7, 3.3 or greater\r\n- future\r\n- numpy >=1.9\r\n- pytables >=3.1\r\n- numba (optional) *to enable a fast HT3 file reader*\r\n\r\n> **Note**\r\n> when installing via `conda` all the dependencies are automatically installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The phconvert library (for developers)\r\n\r\nThe *phconvert* library contains two main modules: `hdf5` and `loader`. The former contains\r\nthe function `save_photon_hdf5()` which is used to create Photon-HDF5 files.\r\n\r\nThe `save_photon_hdf5()` function requires the data to be saved as argument.\r\nThe data needs to have the hierarchical structure of a Photon-HDF5 file.\r\nIn practice, we use a standard python dictionary: each keys is a Photon-HDF5 field name and\r\neach value contains data (e.g. array, string, etc..) or another dictionary\r\n(in which case, it represents an HDF5 sub-group). Similarly, sub-dictionaries\r\ncontain data or other dictionaries, as needed to represent the hierarchy of Photon-HDF5 files.\r\n\r\nThe `loader` module contains loader functions which load data from disk and return a dictionary\r\nto be passed to `save_photon_hdf5()`. These functions can be used as examples\r\nwhen converting a new unsupported file format.\r\n\r\nThe `loader` module contains high-level functions which \"fill\" the dictionary\r\nwith the appropriate arrays. The actual decoding of the input binary files is performed\r\nby low-level functions in other modules (`smreader.py`, `pqreader.py`, `bhreader.py`).\r\nWhen trying to decode a new file format, these modules can provide useful examples.\r\n\r\nThe phconvert repository also contains a JSON specification of the Photon-HDF5 format:\r\n\r\n- [photon-hdf5_specs.json](https://github.com/Photon-HDF5/phconvert/blob/master/phconvert/specs/photon-hdf5_specs.json)\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n*phconvert* is released under the open source MIT license.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nAs with other Photon-HDF5 subprojects, we encourage contributions\r\nin any form, from simple suggestions, typo fix to the addition of new features.\r\nPlease use GitHub by opening Issues or sending Pull Requests.\r\n\r\nAll the contributors will be acknowledged in this website, and will included\r\nas authors in the next software-paper publication.\r\n\r\nFor more details see our [contribution policy](http://photon-hdf5.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html).\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\nThis work was supported by NIH Grant R01-GM95904.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
